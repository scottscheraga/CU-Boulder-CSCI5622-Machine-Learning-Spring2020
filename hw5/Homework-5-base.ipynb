A cell `(i,k)` shall contain the euclidean distance between point $x_i$ and centroid $m_k$\n",
    "- [10 points] `compute_cluster_assignment` : given the distance matrix of size $N \\times K$ return a array of labels in which each element is an integer in the range $[0, K-1]$ and it represents which centroid in the centroid array `self.centroids` that point belongs to.\n",

    "- [10 points] `cluster` : This shall contain you main loop which implements the algorithm described above. You shall sequentially call the methods above to find the $K$ centroids(or means). Keep performing this loop until one of the following conditions is met: 1) you perform `epochs` number of iterations; or 2) the average euclidian difference between old and new centroids goes below 0.01. At the end of each epoch call the method `show_progress()` to show where the centroids are after making the necessary updates.\n",

You must also incorporate logic here to break the loop if the parameters do not change beyond a certain threshold just like you did before in K-means. We give you the liberty of deciding how that will work and what the threshold value should be. Note that finally the parameters should be in close range with the parmaters the data distribution was created with in class `Data1D`."

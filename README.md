_Problem Space_

The film industry involves costly and risky investments and movie studios want to maximize profit and reduce risk especially for large-budget productions. We believe that this risk can be reduced through the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster together movie genres of movies made in the last 20 years, note the profit the movies of that genre over time, through the use of genre and descriptive terms, forecast the profit of a future movies 
This could potentially reduce the need for production studioâ€™s resources to be allocated to research tasks.Manually labeling broad film categories would be time consuming for studios, and unsupervised clustering methods may be able to determine categories that a human categorizer would not notice.
Lastly, the sub-problem of automatically clustering movies together based on characteristics could be useful for digital distribution companies such as Hulu or Netflix, in order to display similar movies together in their interface, easing the browsing of their content.
Our solution is novel because of our use of a two-stage k-means classifier, optimized with elbow analysis in order to better analyze films through subcategorization.
